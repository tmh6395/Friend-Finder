# Friend-Finder


This app will help you find a new friend.  Here is how it works:

## Home Page

There is not much on the home page, so simply click the button to begin the survey!

Or you can click one of the links at the bottom to view the API or the Github repository.

## Survey Page

On the survey page, you will be asked to input your name and a link to an image of yourself.  They are both required! The links to the API and Github repositry are on this page, as well.

Afterwards, you will then answer ten questions, scaled from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).  After you have answered the questions, you will press the "Submit Results" button to view a modal including your newest potential friend!
